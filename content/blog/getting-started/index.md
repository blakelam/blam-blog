I'm not totally new to frontend web development, but I feel like I'm just getting started. The way we build for the web today is vastly different from the way we built when I was coding websites in HTML and CSS not that many years ago. You can make a strong argument these days that [frontend means full stack](https://increment.com/frontend/when-frontend-means-full-stack/).

A lot of the aspects of web development that are now considered "frontend" are things that used to intimidate me quite a bit. This time around, I've decided not to let failed npm package installs and confusing terminal errors stop me from pressing on.

It feels kind of silly, but I'm reminding myself that I have the same capacity to learn and grow as those at the top of their game. Nobody was born a web development master, and with the way things are changing so quickly, no one can stay at the top of their game without a commitment to ongoing growth.

I'm grateful for the many people in the web development community who have dedicated so much time and effort to sharing what they know and making the industry accessible to those getting started. I'll share more of the resources that have been helpful to me in this stage of my journey soon, but for now I encourage you – wherever you are on whatever journey – to press on.
