I'm learning frontend web development, and I'm using this blog to share the ups, downs, and in-betweens along the way.

To build this blog, I'm experimenting with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (starting with [Gatsby's blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)) and deploying on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). There's more to come, but for now I'm celebrating the victory of getting this site online!

Stay tuned.
