I just published the first iteration of my [web development learning hub](https://www.notion.so/blakelam/Blake-s-Learning-Hub-5073a163a17b4fa597c1cee3d68a4c69), and I've been thinking a lot about the benefits of learning in public. Even as I've taken small steps in sharing my journey learning web development, I've seen some great benefits.

## Connection
Just by sharing the fact that I'm diving into web development has already allowed me to connect with friends in the industry who I hadn't spoken to in a long time. I talked with a former co-worker last week, and asking him a few questions about what I'm learning helped things click in ways they hadn't before. It's also been encouraging to hear from friends who don't work in web development who have reached out to cheer me on.

## Accountability
There's not anyone looking over my shoulder to see if I'm making progress on projects and courses, but there is a sense of accountability that comes from sharing things publicly. I've publicly expressed a commitment to learn and share what I'm learning, and I want to honor that commitment.

## Shipping Work
I'm a perfectionist, and it can be hard for me to share things that aren't polished or that have obvious room for improvement. Sharing what I'm learning is a way for me to practice putting work into the world â€“ even if it's incomplete or still in progress.


I'm sure there are many more benefits to learning in public that I'll discover as I continue this journey. Based on the benefits I've experienced so far, it would be silly for me to stop sharing what I'm learning along the way.
