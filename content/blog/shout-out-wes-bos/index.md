My ideas for this blog are still taking shape, but I know that I want to share who I'm learning from along with what I'm learning. One of the things I love about the web development community is that it's a community full of people who are committed to sharing what they know. There are so many resources out there for learning web development that it's hard to sift through them all.

As I've started sifting through those resources, one of the people who's been incredibly helpful to me is [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/). I did a random podcast search for JavaScript and found the [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) podcast that Wes hosts with [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski), and Syntax quickly became one of my favorite podcasts on any subject. Wes and Scott make a seemingly inapproachable topic like web development incredibly approachable and fun.

Syntax led me to Wes' [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course which has gotten me more excited about web development than I've ever been. I think I'll always remember building the drum machine on day one of the course as a pivotal moment in my web development journey. I've already learned so much by coding along with Wes through the course, and I'm not even halfway done. I'm excited to dive into [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) soon.

Wes, if you're reading this, thank you for all you're doing to grow and support the web development community. I'm grateful for your work, and I'm excited to see where all I'm learning from you will take me!
