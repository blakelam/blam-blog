I started this blog as a place to share what I'm learning, but it's quickly becoming a fun project in itself. I've enjoyed all of the courses, articles, and videos I've been learning from, but it's true that there's no better way to learn than by doing.

This blog is continuing to take shape (in its purpose, design, content, etc.), but I already see so much value in shipping work and learning in public. Sharing just a couple of articles already opened the door for me to reconnect with [Stan Wilson](https://github.com/stanwilsonjr) today and to learn from him. Stan inspired me to check out [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and got me thinking about rebuilding the blog from the ground up (without Gatsby's starter template).

I'm excited about the journey ahead, and I'm again grateful to be surrounded by such a generous community.

### What I Worked on Today
* Completed Lesson 14 of [JavaScript 30](http://javascript30.com/)
